Welcome to the accessibility practice site. This is a very simple blog built using jekyll with the explicit purpose of showing accessibility failures and allowing you to practice finding them. 

I would highly encourage you use the template for testing find all the errors yourself. After you are done, watch the video showing the testing by Nick Bristow and see how you did! 

After you have found the errors, I encourage you to fork this repo and attempt to fix the issues! Accessibility can be addressed in numerous ways and I encourage you to share your results!
